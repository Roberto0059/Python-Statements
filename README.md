1. Now you'll write another conditional statement. This one will use a organization_hours variable to check if the user logged in during specific organization hours. When that condition is met, the code should display the string "Login attempt made during organization hours.". When that condition isn't met, the code should display the string "Login attempt made outside of organization hours." The organization_hours variable will have a Boolean data type. If organization_hours has a Boolean value of True, that means the user is logged in during the specified organization hours. If organization_hours has a Boolean value of False, that means the user is not logged in during those hours. <br/>

2. The following cell assembles the code from the previous tasks. It includes the conditional statement that checks if a user is on the allow list and the conditional statement that checks if the user logged in during organization hours. Run the cell below a few times. Each time, enter a different combination of values for username and organization_hours to observe how that affects the output <br/>

3. You can also provide a single message about the login attempt. To do this, you can join both conditions into a single conditional statement using a logical operator. This will make the code more concise. <br/>
